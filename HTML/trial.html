    <h1>CSS SELECTORS</h1>
    <main>
        <article>

            <h2>SELECTOR 1---ELEMENT SELECTOR</h2>

            <h3>ARTICLE 1</h3>
            <p>
                this is the first paragraph of the page.it has no class element defined for itself
            </p>


            <h3>ARTICLE 2</h3>
            <p id="second" class="one">secong paragraph with id and class both defined for this tag
                since the class was specifically defined as one and in the css file we set color 
                as purple for one thus text is purple
                <br>
                syntax:
                <br>  
                .class_name{specifications here}
            </p>

            <h3>ARTICLE 3</h3>
            <p id="third" class="two">
                here we demonstrate the styling of text with given id
                id is a property uniquely defined...i.e it cannot be repeated
                <br>
                syntax:
                <br>
                #id_name{specifications here}
            </p>

            <h3>ARTICLE 4</h3>
            <p>
                here we r going to see the span element transformation...
                it is nothing but any <span> text written between span tags</span>,
                that can be highlighed or made uppercase etc with css
                <br>
                the p span in the css file refers to text in a paragraph btwn span tags
                <br>
                here am going to 
            </p>

            <h3>ARTICLE 5</h3>
            <p>
                here we demostrate the use of *--the universal selector
                anything typed in the braces of these is applied to the whole Page
                <br>
                syntax
                <br>
                *{requirements here}
            </p>

            <h3>ARTICLE 6</h3>
            <p>
                the statements last given in css is the one to be executed
                ....for eg if we give two colours red and yellow for paragraphs
                in different p{}
                and we give red after yellow then the red colour will be applied 
            </p>
