            <article>
                <h2>FONT SIZE</h2>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    here we r setting the font size...if we do so then 
                    even user cannot change it via browser settings.
                    <br>
                    thus it is generally not suggested to set a font size
                </p>

                <h2>SETTING PROPERTIES FOR HEADER AND HEADINGS</h2>
                <p id="headingProp">
                    here we have given width as 50% for the header and then later on we gave 
                    width as 50% for h1 thus finally h1 takes up 25% of screen width
                    and thereby thats why the border around the heading CSS UNITS extends only
                    uptto 25% of screen and does not take up full width
                </p>
                <h2>RELATIVE FONT SIZE</h2>
                <p id="relFontSize">
                    rem is the unit for relativee font size
                    <br>
                    1rem-default size
                    <br>
                    lesser than 1 rem-lower than default size
                    <br>
                    greater than 1 rem-greater than default size
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    rem-relative to the root which is defined by the browser
                    <br>
                    em-relative to the main defined in the html file
                    <br>
                    thus if we change the unit in the p tag (rem--em) then it will 
                    modify the size relative to the one defined for main

                    <h2>USE OF "ch" </h2>
                    <p id="useOfCH">
                        ch--relative unit for width of every character
                        <br>
                        width=40ch implies that we need at max 40 characters before the line wraps up
                        <br>
                        it helps in the estimation of columns when needed
                    </p>

                    <h2>CSS RESET</h2>
                    <p id="cssreset">
                        basically we r resetting the default settings of the page
                        <br>
                        it can be applied to the whole page even...in order to keep all the different topics separate we r 
                        restricting the effect of each statement to separate paragraphs using id                        
                    </p>
